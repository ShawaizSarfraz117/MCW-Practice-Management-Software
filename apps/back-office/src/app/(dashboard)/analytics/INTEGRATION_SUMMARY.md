# Analytics Dashboard API Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. API Enhancement

- Updated `/api/analytics/route.ts` to support all required time ranges:
  - `thisMonth` (default)
  - `lastMonth`
  - `last30days` (newly added)
  - `thisYear` (newly added)
  - `custom` (with startDate and endDate)

### 2. Component Updates

Updated `StatsCard.tsx` components to use only API data:

#### Income Chart

- Now displays only the total income from API (`analyticsData?.income || 0`)
- Removed mock data generation and filtering logic
- Chart data is currently empty (TODO: API needs to return time-series data)

#### Outstanding Balances Chart

- Uses API data: `outstanding` and `uninvoiced` values
- Shows 0 when no data is available
- Calculates percentages based on actual data

#### Appointments Chart

- Shows total appointments from API (`analyticsData?.appointments || 0`)
- All appointments are shown as "Show" status for now
- Other statuses (No Show, Canceled, etc.) show 0
- TODO: API needs to return breakdown by appointment status

#### Notes Chart

- Shows total notes from API (`analyticsData?.notes || 0`)
- All notes are shown as "Note" type for now
- Other types show 0
- TODO: API needs to return breakdown by note type

### 3. Integration with TanStack Query

The existing `useAnalytics` hook in `/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`:

- Properly configured with TanStack Query
- Handles all time range parameters
- Sets stale time to 5 minutes for caching
- Returns loading state and data

### 4. Dashboard Component

The dashboard component (`dashboard.tsx`):

- Manages time range state
- Passes analytics data to all chart components
- Handles loading states
- Time range changes trigger new API calls

## Next Steps

To fully complete the integration, the API needs enhancements:

1. **Time-series data for Income Chart**

   - Return daily/weekly/monthly breakdown of income
   - Format: `[{ date: string, value: number }]`

2. **Appointment status breakdown**

   - Return counts by status (Show, No Show, Canceled, etc.)
   - Format: `{ show: number, noShow: number, canceled: number, ... }`

3. **Notes type breakdown**

   - Return counts by note type/status
   - Format: `{ noNote: number, note: number, locked: number, signed: number }`

4. **Consider adding more detailed analytics endpoints**
   - `/api/analytics/income-series` for time-series income data
   - `/api/analytics/appointment-breakdown` for detailed appointment stats
   - `/api/analytics/notes-breakdown` for detailed notes stats

## Usage

The analytics dashboard now:

- Fetches real data from the API
- Updates automatically when time range changes
- Shows loading states while fetching
- Displays 0 instead of mock data when no data is available
- Supports all filter options (This month, Last 30 days, Last month, This year, Custom)
